 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   This project proposes the specification and implementation of a format
   for data exchange and representation called FRED. This notation
   has a syntax influenced by JSON, although it extends the data model of 
   JSON with more types. It is possible to represent Date, 
   Time and Binary Blobs in FRED. Furthermore it has an extension mechanism 
   inspired by XML and other data formats, it also includes the ability 
   to associate a value with tags and metadata.
   FRED implementation was done in two languages, Haskell and JavaScript.
   A test suite was also created with the objective of validating the implementation
   according to the specfication. Finally, a simple comparison was executed
   between FRED and other formats.
