\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   This project proposes the specfication and implementation of a format
   for data exchange and representation. The name of the format is FRED.
   It utilizes a notation that has a syntax similar to JSON, although
   it extends the data model of JSON, for example it is possible to represent
   Date, Time and Binary Blobs in FRED. Furthermore it has an extension 
   mechanism for this data model, inspired by XML and other data formats.
   Another difference with JSON is that it has a specific notation for
   metadata. FRED is implemented in Haskell and JavaScript and a test suite
   was also created with the objective of validating the implementation
   according to the specfication. Finally, a simple comparison was executed
   between FRED and other formats and it is therefore perceived the need for
   more comparative studies in a variety of use cases.
